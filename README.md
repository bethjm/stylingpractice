Welcome to my web design challenge project! I commit to completing a challenge every day, designing websites, web elements, and more. I use webpage mock ups found on Dribble and bring them to life in the browser. 

In the folders you will find...
-A photo of the mock up titled: "mock-up-to-recreate" 
-A photo of what I was able to recreate titled: "recreated-mock-up"

This folders are titled based on the day I completed the challenge. I've enjoyed being able to clearly see how I my skills imporve day to day.
