Welcome to my web design project 👩🏼‍💻! I am completing a challenge every day; designing websites, web elements, and more. I use webpage mock ups found on Dribble and bring them to life in the browser. 

In the folder 📂 you will find...
📷 A photo of the mock up titled: "mock-up-to-recreate" 
📸 A photo of what I was able to recreate titled: "recreated-mock-up"

This folders are titled with that date 🗓️ that I designed the webpage.
