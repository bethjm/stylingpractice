Welcome to my web design project 👩🏼‍💻! 

I am completing a challenge every day to design websites, web elements, and more based on mock ups found on Dribble. I have really enjoyed the process of bringing them to life in the browser 🥳

In the folder 📂 you will find...

📷 A photo of the mock up titled: "mock-up-to-recreate" 

📸 A photo of what I was able to recreate titled: "recreated-mock-up"

🎞️ As well as the css and html files I used for styling

The folders are titled with that date 🗓️ that I designed the webpage. Enjoy watching how my skills improve!
